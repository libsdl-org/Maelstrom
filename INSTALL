Maelstrom Installation
----------------------

For most systems, installation should just be a matter of typing 'make'
and then 'make install'.

You need the XPM library, which is available (with binaries for some
systems) from ftp.devolution.com in the /pub/maelstrom
directory.  Linux usually comes with this library pre-installed.

If you run Maelstrom without installing it, set the environment variable
"MAELSTROM_LIB" to the full pathname of this directory.

To run Maelstrom, make sure the directory containing the Maelstrom and
Maelstrom_sound binaries is in your path, and just type "Maelstrom" at
a shell prompt.

Linux user's note:  As with all svgalib programs, Maelstrom with SVGA
support needs to be set-uid root, or only root will be able to play.
SVGAlib games are set-uid at your own risk, even though I have done
everything I know to make Maelstrom as safe as possible.

Good luck!
