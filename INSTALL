To build and install the game, get the Simple DirectMedia Layer
library from http://www.devolution.com/~slouken/SDL/ and install
it.  Then run:
	./configure; make; make install

If you are building with Visual C++, unpack VisualC.zip and open
the VC++ project file found in the new "VisualC" directory.
