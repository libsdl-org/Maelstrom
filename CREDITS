The original version of this game was written for the Macintosh by 
Andrew Welch, of Ambrosia Software.  It was ported to Linux and then
to the Simple DirectMedia Layer library by Sam Lantinga.

This would have never come about without the help and encouragement
of many people, too numerous to mention here.

Thank you everybody, you know who you are! :)
