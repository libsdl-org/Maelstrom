Version 1.1.2:
	*	Third Public Release: 10/17/95
	*	Fixed a compiler warning on vga_frambuf.cc
	*	Changed installation directory to /usr/local/bin
	*	Beautified the 'install' target in the Makefile
	*	Added 'uninstall' target to Makefile

	*	Bugs known in Linux X11 version:
			Iconifying Maelstrom doesn't put it in pause mode.

	*	Bugs known in Linux SVGA version:  (unknown causes)
			Keys can get "stuck" between levels.
			Console switching doesn't always pause the game
			After switching consoles, keystrokes cause SIGQUIT ??

	*	Sort-of ported Maelstrom to Solaris 2.4
		Known bugs:	(unknown causes)
			Setting asynchronous I/O in Sound Server returns EINVAL
			Sound support not tested

	*	Sort-of ported Maelstrom to the SGI
		Known bugs:	(unknown causes)
			Fading doesn't work, and neither does -privatecmap
			Some scores are reported as low negative numbers
			No sound support

	*	Sort-of ported Maelstrom to HPUX 10.0
		Known bugs:
			Not tested with X11
			No sound support

Version 1.1.1:
	*	Fixed a slight slowdown bug in mixer.cc
			(Thanks to John Seng <jseng@nwu.edu> for catching it.)
	*	Fixed the "white border" problem on some vga cards (trident)
		(Thanks to Antti J Tanskanen <atanskan@cc.helsinki.fi>)
	*	Fixed a bug in the cheat code, when you enter zero lives.
	*	Fixed a problem with Maelstrom_sound exiting with signal 11.
	*	Added Makefile variable toggling compiling SVGA support.
	*	Added "all-time high" Maelstrom-Scores file.

Version 1.1.0:
	*	Second Public Release: 9/1/95
	*	Made Maelstrom code more portable, using bytecopy macros
		and using shared memory XImages instead of BG pixmaps.
	*	Discovered that shared memory XImages are truly faster
		than shared background pixmaps.  Default to use XImage.
		(Thanks to Peter Mattis <petm@CSUA.Berkeley.EDU>)
	*	Added -speedtest option to test the speed of Maelstrom
		graphics blitting.  SVGA is about 30% faster than shared
		memory XImages in X11, on my system.
	*	Added -gamma N option, allowing gamma correction levels
		from 0 through 8.
	*	Fixed a sound race condition on slow machines.
	*	Added 24 bit color support.

Version 1.0.1:

		for Maelstrom collected from the Internet.
	*	Fixed Maelstrom so it would play the Simpsons sound patch.
	*	BUG: Bonus stage sound can break up during the screen fade
		on slow systems.  The fix is to use a larger sound fragment
		size, but this negatively impacts synchronization of the
		Maelstrom process and the sound server.  Not fixed.
	*	Fixed a coding issue so Maelstrom could be compiled with
		g++ 2.7.0
	*	Defined true and false for compiling with X11R5.
	*	Added 15/16-bit color support.  (Thanks to Peter Mattis)
	*	Fixed problem with Maelstrom leaving shared memory around.
		
Version 1.0:
